# Autoencoder

## Description
This project implements a denoising autoencoder, a type of neural network used to remove noise from images. The autoencoder is trained using noisy images as input and clean images as output, allowing it to learn to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs.

## Features
- Removes noise from images using a denoising autoencoder model
- Trained on a dataset containing both noisy and clean images
- Produces clear images from noisy inputs
